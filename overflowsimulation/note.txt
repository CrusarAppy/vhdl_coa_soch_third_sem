1. Key Features Simulated

Overflow Detection
    Occurs when the result exceeds the range of the data type.
    Detected using carry-out (unsigned) or sign-bit inconsistency (signed numbers).
Signed vs. Unsigned Representation
    Unsigned: Uses std_logic_unsigned for standard binary values.
    Signed: Uses std_logic_signed for handling negative values (Twoâ€™s complement representation).
Arithmetic Operations with Overflow Check
    Addition
    Subtraction
    Multiplication
    Division (with zero handling)
